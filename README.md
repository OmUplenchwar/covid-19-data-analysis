# covid-19-data-analysis
This project analyzes COVID-19 data to explore the spread of the virus over time and across different regions. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and insights derived from trends in cases, deaths, and other factors.

📌 Features of the Project
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data type conversions, and filtering relevant columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, distributions, and correlations in the dataset.
Time-Series Analysis: Visualizing COVID-19 cases over time to detect patterns and spikes.
Geographical Analysis: Mapping the spread of COVID-19 across different countries.
Data Visualization: Creating charts and graphs using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

📂 Dataset
